IGalvez.Autoindex
=================

Apache's mod_autoindex feature is very useful when you want to set up a simple file sharing server, but its design is trapped in 1997. By default it serves HTML 3.2.

So, I decided to give it an overdue makeover by taking advantage of modern components like Bootstrap, jQuery, Google Fonts, and Font Awesome!
